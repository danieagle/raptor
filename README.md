Is Lobster Patented?
-----------------
The source code is released under GPL.
The Lobster algorithms are covered by the following patents:

* NTRUSIGN
* NTRU-HASH TBA
* Lattice based ring signature TBA


The patents will still be enforced but may be used under the GPL, 
i.e. under the condition that any work that uses them is also made available under the GPL. 
The patents and the code implementations are also available under standard commercial terms.
